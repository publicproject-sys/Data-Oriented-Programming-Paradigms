# Data-Oriented-Programming-Paradigms

This project was conducted by my group, consisting of four members, for the course Data-Oriented
Programming Paradigms [Course website](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=2994&dsrid=547&courseNr=188995&semester=2024W&locale=en), with the objective of identifying the conditions associated with the presence of skilled workers born in foreign countries. Our central research question was: "What conditions are associated with the immigration of skilled people?" To answer this, we analyzed a wide range of factors, which we categorized into two main groups: economic and social. These factors were selected based on our understanding of migration dynamics and relevant domain literature. The goal of this analysis was to uncover insights that could inform decision-making related to policies aimed at attracting and retaining skilled labor.
